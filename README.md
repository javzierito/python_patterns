implementation_of_different_design_patterns

Here I show some implementation of different design patterns. The implementations are linked to the most useful ones in python because of its features as language.

Pattens implemented:
- Strategy: functional and partial
- Bridge: classic, using protocols
- Template
- Abstract factory: dict of fnxs used to create sth, good cases of use
- Pipeline: function composition, list of functions, chain of responsiblity
- Observer pattern
- Mediator pattern
- Registry: reading info from json or yaml files, combination with other design patterns
- Command: with partial application

Functional patterns in python:
- passing a function as an argument
- partial fx application or function preparation
- function builder or custom function creator
- function adapter takes one fx and returns another one with different signature
